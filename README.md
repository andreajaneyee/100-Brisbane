# 100% Brisbane
Date: Semester 1, 2017<br><br>
This webpage was a university group project for the course DECO3800. We collaborated with the Museum of Brisbane on their 3-year exhibition, [100% Brisbane](http://www.museumofbrisbane.com.au/whats-on/100-brisbane/), to create a digital layer for the exhibition. My team member, Ellen, and I were put in charge of designing the mockups and developed most of the website. The website itself is incomplete because there is a second part to this course where another group will be in charge of completing it.

NOTE: GitHub pages does not support PHP which means some functions won't work.
